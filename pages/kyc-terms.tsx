                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  At SolaceGold, Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are conducted by an independent, regulated
                  third-party verification provider. This provider handles all aspects of identity verification, document review,
                  and approval or rejection decisions related to customer verification. SolaceGold does not collect, store, view,
                  or make decisions on any user-submitted documents. We act solely as an intermediary facilitating the
                  onboarding process through secure, automated integrations.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  All KYC processes are carried out by a designated external provider. By using SolaceGold's services, users
                  agree that all KYC-related decisions, processing timelines, and documentation evaluations are the sole
                  responsibility of the external provider. SolaceGold bears no liability for any issues arising from such
                  processes, including but not limited to delayed verifications, denied access, or documentation disputes.

                  SolaceGold does not access, view, or store any documents submitted during the KYC process. All personal
                  data is handled exclusively by the third-party provider in accordance with their privacy policy and applicable
                  data protection laws. SolaceGold cannot and will not intervene in the document review process.

                  verification process. Failure to do so may result in rejection or delays, for which SolaceGold bears no
                  responsibility. Users must contact the third-party KYC provider directly in the event of disputes or
                  clarifications.
